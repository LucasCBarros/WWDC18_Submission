 # **The Game:**
 
 Let's start at "Hello" 😃
 
 ![Hello](HELLO!.png)
 
 **How it works:**
 - You can select any equation on green panels, when you choose one it will become purple and four answers options will apear under the board.
 (*Be careful there is only one correct answer!* 😉 )

 - When you get one answer correct you will earn 10 points 🎉🎉🎉
 (*Hint: The more answers you get right in a row the more your points will be multiplied!* 😮 )
 - But if you get it wrong the panel will become red and change the answer options with new values for you to try again.

 - Every time you solve an equation a new path will open shown by new green panels. Find your way to WWDC18 and don't get lost...
 (*Try your best to get the bigest score among your friends, and good luck!*🍀)
